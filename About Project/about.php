      <p class="info">
        1.	Design and develop a battery-operated wireless monitoring system (WMS) which can continuously communicate with a server.
        The WMS should send an alert message to the server if movement or power disconnect is detected. 
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        2.	The WMS should be small enough to be placed in laboratory equipment such as an oscilloscope, power supply or function generator. 
        The battery in the WMS should charge when the equipment is plugged into the mains.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        3.	Design and implement a web server to communicate with multiple WMS.  The web server should link a WMS ID to a specific equipment.  
        The web server should show if the equipment is online, offline, plugged in or out, moving or not moving.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        4.	The web server should send an email alert and enable an alarm if equipment is moved. 
      </p>
      <p class="info">5.	The web server application should be designed to add, edit or delete a WMS.</p>
      <p class="info">6.	The web server application should have a table that shows the inventory of the equipment being monitored.</p>
